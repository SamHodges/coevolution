; TEACHER
; ingredients- total test set, eg regression input/outputs

; mutation function- change which test sets are being chosen

; error function- look at how much students improved

; main loop for evolving- run every x loops of student evolving



; STUDENT
; ingredients- potentially ingredients to find linear regression?

; mutation function- change equation

; error function- how far off given teacher input/outputs answer key

; main loop for evolving:
; - different students given different test cases
; - every x loops call teacher so it can evolve
